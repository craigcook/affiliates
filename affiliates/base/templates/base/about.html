        Firefox Affiliate buttons are bits of HTML code that you put on your
        website or blog to encourage visitors to download Firefox. When
        someone clicks a button on your site and visits the Firefox download
        page, you get credit for that click.

            It’s super easy! To start, choose a button and select the Firefox
            product or campaign you’d like to support. From there, simply pick
            your button’s style, shape and color, and then copy and paste the
            code into the HTML of your site. Done! Your unique affiliate ID
            will be in the code to make sure you get credit for every click
            you send our way.

            Text links work very much like banners. You start by choosing the
            Firefox product or campaign you’d like to support, then select the
            text link you’d like to use. Copy and paste the link code into the
            HTML of your site, onto your email signature, or anywhere else
            you’d like to have it appear. Your unique affiliate ID will be in
            the code to make sure you get credit for every click you send our

            Sometimes we run special time-limited campaigns to encourage
            people to download Firefox. If you’re using an affiliate button
            for one of these campaigns, try to update your button as soon as
            you can. People who click on that button will be directed to a
            general Firefox download page. You’ll get credit for the click as
            an Affiliate, but you may not get credit for clicks for that
            specific campaign.

            Smart Banners show visitors slightly different messages depending
            on their browser. For example, visitors on an older version of
            Firefox would be encouraged to upgrade, while visitors on Internet
            Explorer would be encouraged to switch.
