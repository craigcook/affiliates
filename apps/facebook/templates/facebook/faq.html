              Firefox Affiliates allows you to build banners and place them on
              your Facebook profile to encourage visitors to download Firefox.
              When a visitor to your page or status update clicks on a banner
              and visits the Firefox download page, you get credit for that
              click. Affiliates who get a lot of clicks through their profile
              will be featured on our leaderboard and be eligible for fun stuff
              like Firefox T-shirts and, if you opt in, we may feature your
              banner in a paid-ad on the Facebook ad network. While we do send
              out prizes and gifts to our Affiliates from time to time,
              Firefox Affiliates does not offer monetary rewards for hosting
              Firefox banners.

              If you checked the box to allow your banner to be featured in a
              paid Facebook ad, once you've reached {{ click_count }} clicks on
              a Facebook banner, your banner will become eligable to be a paid
              Facebook ad. This means that Mozilla will pay to have an ad
              placed on the Facebook ad network sharing (remove the t in
              sharing) your message of why you love Firefox. We will notify
              you if your banner is chosen to be a paid ad in your region. If
              you do not want to participate in this, don't click the opt-in
              when you build your banner. If you've opted in by accident,
              please contact us at
              <a href="{{ link }}">affiliates@mozilla.org</a> and we'll make
              sure you aren't included in the ad selection.
